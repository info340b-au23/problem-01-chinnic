<h1>Shang Chi</h1>

<img src="img/shangchi.jpeg" alt="A Picture of Shang Chi">

<p>Shang Chi is from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe"> Marvel Comics Universe</a>, and was recently made more well-known from his recent 2021 movie, <em>Shang-Chi and The Legend of The 10 Rings</em>. He is a Chinese superhero that has the power of supreme knowledge in all martial arts and intelligence. In the movie, he showcases his skills very well and makes the movie extremely enjoyable to watch. Here are the reasons why I like this character: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Great asian superhero representation which makes me proud. </li>
    <li>Super cool fighting skills that look great on the big screen. </li>
    <li class="favorite">The actor, Simu Liu, is a humble and deserving dude! </li>
  </ul>
